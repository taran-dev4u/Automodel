# Retrieval Data Tools

This directory contains CPU-side utilities for preparing retrieval training data before launching GPU training jobs.

## Which Option Should I Use?

For full-scale vision-language (VL) retrieval, prepare **normalized Arrow** on CPU nodes before requesting GPUs.

**Do not start full-scale VL training directly from unprepared raw sources.** Loading a large image corpus and building
its dataset cache can substantially delay the first training step. In a multi-GPU job, the GPUs remain allocated during
that startup, which can waste GPU-hours before optimization begins. Run the normalized dataset preparation script on CPU
nodes first, then point the training config at the generated Arrow dataset.

- **Original dataset config:** use `RetrievalDatasetConfig` for typical text-only retrieval, `hf://` sources, inline
  JSONL, and small verification runs.
- **Normalized Arrow:** recommended for full-scale or image-heavy VL retrieval. Prepare a portable dataset bundle once,
  then train with
  `nemo_automodel.components.datasets.llm.retrieval_dataset_normalized.NormalizedRetrievalDatasetConfig`.
- **Warm HF cache:** use the CPU cache-warming script when direct source loading starts slowly and you want to keep the
  original dataset configuration.

Although some file names include `vl`, normalization also accepts text-only corpus ID-based JSON sources. It can help
with an unusually large text corpus or when you need a portable prepared dataset.

## Normalized Arrow (Recommended for Full-Scale VL)

Normalized Arrow keeps the original retrieval structure, but prepares the corpus once and saves it as a reusable Arrow
bundle:

- Train rows store query text plus positive/negative document IDs.
- Each source's local corpus shards store every referenced document and optional image once.
- Training still resolves `doc_id -> document`, but it reads from local Arrow instead of rebuilding Hugging Face cache
  state in the GPU job.

This is the recommended format for full-scale VL datasets because it is portable and avoids duplicating image payload
in every training row.

### Prepare

The normalization tool accepts local corpus ID-based JSON sources. Before running it, make sure every entry in the
config's `dataset.data_dir_list` points to that local format. The tool does not accept `hf://` URIs or inline JSONL
directly. Materialize those sources as corpus ID-based JSON first, or keep using `RetrievalDatasetConfig` and optionally
warm its Hugging Face cache.

```bash
uv run python tools/retrieval/prepare_normalized_vl_retrieval_data.py \
  --config /path/to/retrieval_config_with_local_json_sources.yaml \
  --output-dir /path/to/normalized_vl_retrieval
```

On Slurm CPU nodes, use the array launcher for full-scale VL datasets before submitting the GPU training job. Set
`NUM_SOURCES` to the number of entries in the config's `dataset.data_dir_list`. Each array task prepares one source,
then a dependent finalizer writes the top-level metadata after every source succeeds:

```bash
CONFIG=/path/to/retrieval_config_with_local_json_sources.yaml \
OUT_DIR=/path/to/normalized_vl_retrieval \
NUM_SOURCES=7 \
PARTITION=cpu_short \
TIME=04:00:00 \
CPUS_PER_TASK=32 \
ARRAY_PARALLELISM=7 \
EXTRA_CONTAINER_MOUNTS=/path/to/source_data:/path/to/source_data \
tools/retrieval/submit_prepare_normalized_vl_retrieval_data_cpu_array.sh
```

The non-array `submit_prepare_normalized_vl_retrieval_data_cpu.sh` launcher is useful for small verification runs and
short source lists, but it prepares sources serially.

### Train

```yaml
dataset:
  _target_: nemo_automodel.components.datasets.llm.retrieval_dataset_normalized.NormalizedRetrievalDatasetConfig
  data_path: /path/to/normalized_vl_retrieval
  model_type: bi_encoder
  data_type: train
  n_passages: 5
```

### Choose Sources Or Sample Caps

A normalized bundle stores each original `data_dir_list` entry as a separate numeric source directory:
`sources/source-00000`, `sources/source-00001`, and so on. The top-level metadata records the readable `source_name`,
stable `source_key`, original `source_entry`, and source path.

For normal training with one bundle, pass its top-level path as `data_path`, as shown above. If you want to choose
specific prepared sources, cap samples per source, or combine bundles, use `data_dir_list` instead. Do not set both
fields.

```yaml
dataset:
  _target_: nemo_automodel.components.datasets.llm.retrieval_dataset_normalized.NormalizedRetrievalDatasetConfig
  data_dir_list:
    - path: /path/to/normalized_vl_retrieval/sources/source-00000
      num_samples: 10000
    - path: /path/to/normalized_vl_retrieval/sources/source-00001
      num_samples: null
  model_type: bi_encoder
  data_type: train
  n_passages: 5
```

The same `data_dir_list` form can also combine different normalized bundle roots:

```yaml
dataset:
  _target_: nemo_automodel.components.datasets.llm.retrieval_dataset_normalized.NormalizedRetrievalDatasetConfig
  data_dir_list:
    - path: /path/to/normalized_vl_retrieval_a
      num_samples: 20000
    - path: /path/to/normalized_vl_retrieval_b
      num_samples: null
  model_type: bi_encoder
  data_type: train
  n_passages: 5
```

You can mix top-level bundle roots and individual `sources/source-*` paths in the same list. Avoid overlapping entries,
for example listing both `/path/to/normalized_vl_retrieval` and
`/path/to/normalized_vl_retrieval/sources/source-00000`, unless you intentionally want duplicated samples.

### Add More Normalized Data

There are two supported workflows.

The simplest workflow is to prepare the new source into a separate normalized bundle, then list both bundle roots in
the training `data_dir_list`. This avoids modifying the existing bundle and is the recommended approach when you need
to reproduce earlier training runs from the same paths.

If you want one shared bundle path, use append mode. Run prep with a config that contains only the new source(s), the
same `OUT_DIR`, and `APPEND=1`:

```bash
CONFIG=/path/to/new_source_only_config.yaml \
OUT_DIR=/path/to/normalized_vl_retrieval \
APPEND=1 \
tools/retrieval/submit_prepare_normalized_vl_retrieval_data_cpu.sh
```

Append mode skips exact duplicate source entries already present in metadata. It stages each new source in a temporary
directory and updates top-level metadata only after all new sources finish. It does not deduplicate documents across
different sources, so do not re-list old sources under a modified path or config entry.

Append changes the bundle's source composition. Once you use a bundle for a reproducible training run, treat that
bundle as immutable or use separate bundles for later additions. When training loads normalized data, it logs the
existing top-level and source metadata, including the format version, source list, record counts, and shard paths.

### Resume an Interrupted Preparation Run

If the local preparation command stops before it finishes, run the same command again with `--resume`:

```bash
uv run python tools/retrieval/prepare_normalized_vl_retrieval_data.py \
  --config /path/to/retrieval_config_with_local_json_sources.yaml \
  --output-dir /path/to/normalized_vl_retrieval \
  --resume
```

The tool keeps work that finished successfully and rebuilds incomplete output. Use the same input data, config, output
directory, and preparation settings as the original run. If the input data changed, or the tool cannot confirm that it is
unchanged, start again with a new output directory.

For Slurm array preparation, submit the same launcher command again. Resume is enabled by default, so no extra option is
needed. Keep `CONFIG`, `OUT_DIR`, `NUM_SOURCES`, and the other preparation settings unchanged.

Use resume only to continue an interrupted run. To add new sources to a finished bundle, use
[append mode](#add-more-normalized-data).

## Warm Hugging Face Dataset Cache

This option keeps the original `RetrievalDatasetConfig` in the training config unchanged.

The script populates the Hugging Face cache on CPU nodes so the GPU job can reuse it. It does not create a portable
dataset.

```bash
CONFIG=/path/to/original_retrieval_config.yaml \
CACHE_DIR=/path/to/hf_cache \
PARTITION=cpu_short \
TIME=02:00:00 \
CPUS_PER_TASK=32 \
TOUCH_SAMPLES=128 \
EXTRA_CONTAINER_MOUNTS=/path/to/source_data:/path/to/source_data \
tools/retrieval/submit_warm_retrieval_hf_cache_cpu.sh
```

The same `CACHE_DIR` should be mounted into GPU training and exported as `HF_HOME`, `HF_DATASETS_CACHE`,
`HF_HUB_CACHE`, `HUGGINGFACE_HUB_CACHE`, and `TRANSFORMERS_CACHE`.

HF cache reuse is exact-key based. A warm cache is reused only when the later training run uses the same cache directory
and the same effective dataset fingerprint. The fingerprint can change if the same source data is referenced through a
different mount alias, symlink, or config path, for example `/lustre/fsw/...` compared to `/lustre/fs11/...`.

For local/non-Slurm use:

```bash
uv run python tools/retrieval/warm_retrieval_hf_cache.py \
  --config /path/to/original_retrieval_config.yaml \
  --cache-dir /path/to/hf_cache \
  --touch-samples 128
```

`--touch-samples` reads transformed examples to validate corpus lookup and image decoding. Decoded images are not
persisted.

## Storage Comparison

Measured on the Nemotron VL 1B image-retrieval training set used in debugging, with 262,197 train rows:

| Path | What it stores | Size observed | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| Original HF cache | Hugging Face cache fingerprints and materialized source corpora under `HF_DATASETS_CACHE` | `3.7 TB` in one observed active cache dir, which varies by cache history | Fast when warm, but not portable and can grow with each fingerprint/config/path variant |
| Normalized Arrow | Train refs plus deduplicated local corpus Arrow shards | `176 GB` | Recommended full-dataset portable format |

The exact HF cache size can vary because Hugging Face Datasets may keep multiple fingerprints, source downloads,
intermediate Arrow files, and old variants. Normalized Arrow is an explicit dataset artifact, so the size is much more
predictable.

## Add New Corpus Schemas

For new corpus schemas, use the original AutoModel extension point:

1. Add an `AbstractDataset` implementation with `get_document_by_id()` and `get_all_ids()`.
2. Register it in `DATASETS`.
3. Add the source JSON to the original retrieval config.
4. Prepare a normalized bundle or warm the original Hugging Face cache.
