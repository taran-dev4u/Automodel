"""ViSpec stage-2 draft-training objective (multi-token rollout + distribution losses).

Two things separate this from the EAGLE-1/2 objective in ``core_v12.py``:

* **Self-rollout supervision.** After the first draft pass, the draft's *own*
  predicted hidden states are shifted right by one and fed back as its input
  features, ``mtp_steps`` times. Every rollout is supervised against the same
  target distribution. Training only on the target's fresh hidden states lets
  the draft lean on information it will not have at drafting depth > 1; rolling
  its own output back in removes that shortcut.
* **Distribution losses instead of hidden-state regression.** ViSpec drops the
  SmoothL1 hidden-state term entirely and supervises the *distribution*: an L1
  distance between the draft's and the target's full-vocab probabilities, plus a
  ListMLE ranking term over the target's top-k tokens.

Reference implementation: ``vispec/train/main_mtp.py`` in
https://github.com/KangJialiang/ViSpec.
