"""Frame-level context-parallel vision-tower sharding.

Under context parallelism (CP), a VLM must encode media and splice the resulting
features before it shards the language sequence. Without vision frame sharding,
``self.visual(...)`` runs the ENTIRE vision tower on the full, un-sharded set of
images on EVERY CP rank. With ``cp_size=N`` that is N x redundant compute and
O(all-images) vision activations per rank.

Qwen3-VL-style vision towers attend per IMAGE/FRAME ("entry"): the forward builds
``cu_seqlens`` from ``grid_thw`` so each entry only attends within itself.  Entries
are therefore INDEPENDENT units, and

    visual(all_entries) == concat_r visual(entries_owned_by_rank_r)    (entry order)

holds up to numerical precision (``allclose``; all CP ranks already hold identical
vision weights after the FSDP2 all-gather -- the replicated design relies on that
too).  So we partition the entries across the CP group, run ``self.visual`` on each
rank's slice, and all-gather the per-entry embeddings back to the full set.  The
downstream scatter into ``inputs_embeds`` and the sequence shard consume numerically
equivalent embeds through the unchanged code path.

Memory/compute: vision forward + activations drop ~cp_size x; the final gathered
embeds (small vs the ViT's internal patch activations) are reconstructed in full
on every rank, then immediately sequence-sharded by the existing CP sharder.

Sharding-group scope (deliberate, machine-checked design constraint): the caller
declares the scope of the process group it publishes via
``set_cp_vision_group(group, config=..., spans_only_cp=...)``. With a FROZEN vision tower,
frames may be sharded across the full CP x TP rank set (``spans_only_cp=False``):
the forward is numerically equivalent (``allclose``; per-frame independence,
replicated weights) and
``requires_grad=False`` means no backward ever runs through the gather.  With a
TRAINABLE vision tower, only a CP-only group (``spans_only_cp=True``, the default)
is valid: the vision tower is replicated (not tensor-parallel) across TP ranks,
so gathering frames across CP x TP would make the all-gather's
reduce-scatter(SUM) backward accumulate the vision gradient tp-fold (each
TP-replicated sequence shard backprops into the single compute rank).
:func:`maybe_distribute_visual` raises when a trainable tower meets a group not
declared CP-only.  Under pure TP (``cp_size == 1``) the published group has size
1, so this sharding is not enabled.

    ``pooler_output`` (and ``deepstack_features`` list, if any) are the FULL gathered
    embeds in original entry order -- a drop-in for the direct ``visual(...)`` call.

    Falls back to the plain replicated call (exact pre-sharding behaviour) when sharding
    is disabled, no CP group is active, ``cp_size <= 1``, there are no media inputs, or
    the visual workload is below the minimum sharding size.

    Args:
        visual: The vision tower; must expose ``spatial_merge_size`` and accept
            ``visual(pixel_values, grid_thw=..., return_dict=True)``.
        pixel_values: ``[total_patch_rows, patch_dim]`` pixel rows for ALL entries,
            frame-contiguous in entry order (entry order, then frame order within each
            entry) -- the exact tensor the replicated call would receive.  ``None``
            (no media in the batch) is forwarded to ``visual`` unchanged.
        grid_thw: ``[N, 3]`` tensor, one (t, h, w) row per media entry (N = entries;
            ``t * h * w`` patch rows per entry).  Expected on CPU.  ``None`` (no media
            in the batch) is forwarded to ``visual`` unchanged.

    Returns:
        The vision tower's output object.  ``pooler_output`` is the full gathered
        ``[total_patch_rows / spatial_merge_size**2, H]`` merged-token tensor in original
        entry order (H = vision output hidden size); each entry of ``deepstack_features``
        (when present) is gathered to the same shape.  ``last_hidden_state`` is left as
        the local shard (unused downstream).  Forward and vision-parameter gradients are
        numerically equivalent (``allclose``) to the replicated call's.

    Raises:
        ValueError: When the vision tower has trainable parameters but the published
            group was declared ``spans_only_cp=False`` (see :func:`set_cp_vision_group`),
            or when any rank's local visual output does not match its planned token count.
            The token-count mismatch is reduced across the sharding group before raising, so
            a single diverging rank makes EVERY rank raise (rather than deadlocking peers on
