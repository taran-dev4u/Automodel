"""Block-diagonal (per-document) varlen context parallelism for packed sequences.

Packed-sequence training concatenates many documents into one long sequence; a
correct attention mask is block-causal per document. The stock DTensor
``context_parallel`` path assumes a single causal document, so packed VLM/LLM
batches need a CP implementation that reshards by contiguous chunks and rebuilds
per-document masking on every rank.

This package provides that implementation, split by responsibility:

- :mod:`.state`   -- runtime knob normalization + activation-checkpoint-safe step state.
- :mod:`.kernels` -- dense-mask and varlen (FlashAttention / TransformerEngine) kernels.
- :mod:`.exchange` -- differentiable K/V collectives (all-gather, left-halo, all-to-all-v).
- :mod:`.runtime` -- the SDPA entry point and collective-safe path selection.
- :mod:`.batch`   -- batch padding/sharding and the per-step train context.
- :mod:`.packed`  -- the cp_size==1 packed-sequence varlen SDPA hook.

Integration follows the model-owned CP convention of
:func:`nemo_automodel.components.distributed.cp_utils.make_cp_batch_and_ctx`: a model
attaches :func:`make_cp_blockdiag_batch_and_ctx` to the batch as ``_cp_make_batch_fn``
and routes its softmax attention through :func:`cp_blockdiag_sdpa` while the returned
context is active. For ``cp_size == 1`` packed runs, the model scopes the varlen SDPA
patch to its attention forwards with :func:`attach_cp1_packed_varlen_hooks` and arms
the per-forward state with :func:`enable_cp1_packed_varlen` /
:func:`disable_cp1_packed_varlen`.

Only these integration entry points are exported; everything else (knob
normalization, varlen metadata precompute, fire counters, kernels) is an internal
detail of the package's modules. Model wiring lands in follow-up PRs.
