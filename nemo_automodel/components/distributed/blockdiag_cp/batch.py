    Pads the sequence to a multiple of the CP world size, slices each

    slice for ``inputs_embeds``, so gradients flow back to the trainable vision
    tower / embedding table), and returns ``(train_ctx, batch)`` where entering
    ``train_ctx`` activates the per-document CP SDPA state for the step.

    Softmax attention must route through
    :func:`~nemo_automodel.components.distributed.blockdiag_cp.runtime.cp_blockdiag_sdpa`
    while this context is active. A model opts in by attaching this callable to
    the batch as ``_cp_make_batch_fn`` (the model-owned CP hook honored by
    :func:`nemo_automodel.components.distributed.cp_utils.make_cp_batch_and_ctx`)
    and rebinding its attention's SDPA call for the step.

    Args:
        cp_mesh: The context-parallel device (sub)mesh.
        tp_mesh: Accepted for ``_cp_make_batch_fn`` signature compatibility;
            unused (block-diagonal CP shards only the sequence dimension).
        batch: The training batch. Must contain pre-embedded ``inputs_embeds``
            ``[B, S, H]`` (multimodal token replacement happens pre-shard) and is
            mutated in place: ``attention_mask`` is dropped, ``padding_mask``
            ``[B, S]`` (bool, True == pad) is added, and every sequence-aligned
            tensor is padded then sliced to this rank's ``[row_offset,
            row_offset + S_full/cp)`` chunk.
        loss_mask: Optional per-token loss mask ``[B, S]``; padded with 0 and
            sharded like the other sequence-aligned tensors (stored back into
            ``batch["loss_mask"]``).
        padding_token_id: Accepted for signature compatibility; unused (the
            batch is pre-embedded, so there are no token ids to pad).

    Returns:
