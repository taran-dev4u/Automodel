"""Masking-sanity check for the CoderForge SFT training data.

Loads the EXACT training ChatDataset (same tokenizer / seq_length / JSONL) used by the
gemma4_31b_coderforge recipe and inspects the per-sample labels to confirm the SFT actually
supervised the right tokens. "Loss dropped" only means loss dropped on whatever was supervised;
if masking is broken (all-masked, everything-supervised, or wrong spans) then loss-down /
capability-down is a BUG, not a finding.

For a few samples it reports:
  - supervised fraction (labels != -100); flags ~0% (nothing learned) or ~100% (user/tool text
    also supervised -> the model imitates non-assistant text).
  - whether the gemma4 stop token <turn|> (106) falls inside supervised spans.
  - a decoded supervised span vs a decoded masked span, so a human can eyeball that ASSISTANT
    content (incl. tool_calls) is supervised and system/user/tool-result content is masked.
